## C++ Farkle Game
Console-Based Dice Game with Object-Oriented Programming
Developed a console-based Farkle game using C++ and object-oriented programming principles. The game features a turn-based system where players roll dice, score based on specific combinations, and manage game states to maximize their score while avoiding the risk of Farkling (scoring no points in a turn).

Key Features:
✔ Object-Oriented Design – Utilized classes to manage game entities like dice, players, and the game logic.
✔ Turn-Based Scoring System – Implemented the classic Farkle rules, including scoring combinations and risk management.
✔ File Output – Displays rule for game from a file.
✔ Randomized Dice Rolls – Created randomized dice rolls to simulate fair gameplay, following the Farkle rules.
✔ Game State Management – Managed different states of the game (e.g., ongoing, game over).
