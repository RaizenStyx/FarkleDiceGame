Welcome to Farkle! Farkle is a dice game that is multi-player with a minimum of two players, but no upper limit on the number of participants. The goal is to reach 10,000 points first. Here are the rules:

Points:
- A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.
- A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.
- Three (3) dice rolled at the same time with the same value is worth 100 times the face value.
  - Example: three 2's rolled is 200 points, three 5's rolled is 500 points.
- Exception: Three 1's rolled is 1,000 points rather than 100 points.

The Play:
- The first player rolls all six dice at the same time and sets aside any "point dice" (1s, 5s, or three of a kind).
- The player can continue rolling the remaining dice to collect more points or stop and keep their points.
- A Farkle occurs when the dice are rolled and no point dice appear.
  - The player loses all points collected in that turn and play passes to the next player.
- If a player stops rolling before a Farkle, their collected points are recorded.
- If all six dice become point dice, the player must roll all six dice again at least once before stopping.

Entering the Game:
- A player must score at least 1,000 points in one turn to officially enter the game and record points.
- Until a player enters, they must continue rolling until reaching 1,000 points.
- Players may strategically choose to set aside certain dice to increase their chances of scoring higher.

Winning:
- The first player to reach 10,000 points triggers a final round.
- Each other player gets one last turn to try to beat the highest score.
- If no one beats it, the first player to reach 10,000 wins.
- If another player surpasses the score, they become the winner.
